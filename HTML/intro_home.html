       <p> Hello and welcome to Humboldt Hike!
        The purpose of this web application is 
        to allow for those in the Humboldt area to search
        for hiking trails for their chosen activities.  
        We hope to accomplish this task by having our users take
        a short questionnaire about their upcoming activitity.
